Far out in the sea where the water is very deep, the Sea King ruled the undersea world.

In the deepest spot of the sea was his castle. The walls were made of blue coral.  
On the roof were shells that opened and closed when the water passed by. 
And that is where the Sea King lived with his mother and four daughters, each one born a year apart.

The youngest of the four princesses was the Little Mermaid. 
She spent much of her time swimming to ships that had fallen to the bottom of the sea.  
The ships held treasures from the world above! She would fill her arms and set up her collection here and there. 
All the while she would sing. As she did, fish circled around to hear her.  
For the Little Mermaidâ€™s voice was the most beautiful one under the sea.
